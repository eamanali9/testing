    content: `# Résumé & Portfolio Building

## Crafting Your Professional Story

Your résumé and portfolio are your career calling cards. They're often the first impression you make on potential employers, so making them count is crucial.

### Building a Strong Résumé

**Essential Components:**
- Clear contact information and professional summary
- Education section with GPA (if 3.0+), relevant coursework
- Work experience with quantifiable achievements
- Technical skills and certifications
- Projects that demonstrate your abilities
- Leadership and extracurricular activities

**Formatting Tips:**
- Keep it to one page for students/early career
- Use clean, professional fonts (Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman)
- Maintain consistent formatting and spacing
- Use bullet points for easy scanning
- Save and send as PDF to preserve formatting

**Action Verb Power:**
Start each bullet point with strong action verbs: developed, implemented, designed, led, analyzed, created, optimized, collaborated, managed, achieved.

**Quantify Your Impact:**
- Instead of: "Worked on team project"
- Write: "Collaborated with 5-person team to develop mobile app with 500+ downloads"

### Creating Your Portfolio

**Why You Need a Portfolio:**
A portfolio brings your résumé to life by showing, not just telling, what you can do. It's especially important for technical, creative, and project-based roles.

**What to Include:**
- 3-5 of your best projects
- Brief description of each project's purpose and your role
- Technologies or tools used
- Screenshots, demos, or links to live projects
- GitHub repositories for code projects
- Results and impact (users, performance metrics, etc.)

**Portfolio Platforms:**
- Personal website (using GitHub Pages, Wix, or WordPress)
- GitHub for code projects
- Behance or Dribbble for design work
- Medium or personal blog for writing samples

**Tips for Success:**
- Quality over quantity - showcase your best work
- Include diverse projects that show range
- Write clear, concise project descriptions
- Keep everything updated and functioning
- Make it easy to navigate and visually appealing

### ATS Optimization

**What is ATS?**
Applicant Tracking Systems scan résumés for keywords before human eyes see them. Beat the bots by:
- Using keywords from the job description
- Avoiding complex formatting, tables, or graphics
- Using standard section headings
- Spelling out acronyms at least once
- Saving as a PDF (unless otherwise specified)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Typos and grammatical errors
- Generic objective statements
- Listing duties instead of achievements
- Inconsistent formatting
- Including irrelevant information
- Using personal pronouns (I, me, my)
- Outdated or unprofessional email addresses`

## Master Behavioral Interviews

Behavioral interviews focus on how you've handled situations in the past to predict your future performance. Success comes from preparation and authentic storytelling.

### Understanding Behavioral Interviews

- Describe a situation where...
- How did you handle...

**What Interviewers Assess:**
- Problem-solving ability
- Leadership and teamwork
- Communication skills
- Adaptability and learning
- Conflict resolution
- Time management
- Initiative and motivation

### The STAR Method

Structure your answers using STAR for clear, compelling responses:

**S - Situation:**
Set the context (2-3 sentences)
- Where and when did this happen?
- What was the background?

**T - Task:**
Explain the challenge (1-2 sentences)
- What was your responsibility?
- What problem needed solving?

**A - Action:**
Describe what YOU did (4-5 sentences)
- What specific steps did you take?
- Why did you choose this approach?
- Focus on YOUR actions, not the team's

**R - Result:**
Share the outcome (2-3 sentences)
- What was the impact?
- What did you learn?
- Use numbers when possible

### Preparing Your Stories

**Create Your Story Bank:**
Prepare 6-8 stories that demonstrate different competencies. Each story should be 1.5-2 minutes long.

**Story Categories to Cover:**
1. Leadership/Initiative
2. Teamwork/Collaboration
3. Problem-Solving
4. Overcoming Challenges
5. Conflict Resolution
6. Learning from Failure
7. Time Management
8. Innovation/Creativity

**Example Story (Leadership):**

*Situation:* In my junior year, our student organization was struggling with low attendance at events, down 40% from the previous year.

*Task:* As the newly elected VP, I was responsible for increasing engagement and rebuilding our community.

*Action:* I surveyed 50 members to understand their needs, discovered they wanted more career-focused events. I created a mentorship program connecting students with alumni, organized 3 industry panels, and launched a social media campaign highlighting member success stories.

*Result:* Within one semester, event attendance increased by 65%, and membership grew by 30%. The mentorship program became permanent, with 25 mentor-mentee pairs formed.

### Common Behavioral Questions
